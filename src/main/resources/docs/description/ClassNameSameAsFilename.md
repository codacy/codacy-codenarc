*Since CodeNarc 0.19*

Reports files containing only one top level class / enum / interface
which is named differently than the file.

NOTE: This is a file-based rule, rather than an AST-based rule, so the
*applyToClassNames* and *doNotApplyToClassNames* rule configuration
properties are not available. See [Standard Properties for Configuring
Rules](./codenarc-configuring-rules.html#standard-properties-for-configuring-rules).
