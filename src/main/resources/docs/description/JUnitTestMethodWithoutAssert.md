*Since CodeNarc 0.12*

This rule searches for test methods that do not contain assert
statements. Either the test method is missing assert statements, which
is an error, or the test method contains custom assert statements that
do not follow a proper assert naming convention. Test methods are
defined as public void methods that begin with the work test or have a
@Test annotation. By default this rule applies to the default test class
names, but this can be changed using the rule’s applyToClassNames
property. An assertion is defined as either using the `assert` keyword
or invoking a method that starts with the work assert, like
assertEquals, assertNull, or assertMyClassIsSimilar. Also, any method
named `should.*` also counts as an assertion so that `shouldFail`
methods do not trigger an assertion, any method that starts with `fail**
counts as an assertion, and any method that starts with`verify\` counts
as an assertion. Since version 0.23 CodeNarc has support for JUnit’s
ExpectedException.

What counts as an assertion method can be overridden using the
assertMethodPatterns property of the rule. The default value is this
comma separated list of regular expressions:

``` 
    String assertMethodPatterns = 'assert.*,should.*,fail.*,verify.*,expect.*'
```

If you’d like to add any method starting with ‘ensure’ to the ignores
then you would set the value to this:

``` 
    'assert.*,should.*,fail.*,verify.*,ensure.*'
```
