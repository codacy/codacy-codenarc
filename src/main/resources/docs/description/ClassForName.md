Using `Class.forName(...)` is a common way to add dynamic behavior to a
system. However, using this method can cause resource leaks because the
classes can be pinned in memory for long periods of time. If youâ€™re
forced to do dynamic class loading then use ClassLoader.loadClass
instead. All variations of the `Class.forName(...)` method suffer from
the same problem.

Example of violations:

        Class.forName('SomeClassName')
        Class.forName(aClassName, true, aClassLoader)
