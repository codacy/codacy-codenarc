*Since CodeNarc 3.5.0*

Overridden methods of the standard library (e.g. from java.lang.Object)
are often called from there and therefore must not be CPS transformed in
Jenkins. See also the Jenkins docs on [Overrides of non-CPS-transformed
methods](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/cps-method-mismatches/#overrides-of-non-cps-transformed-methods).

Examples:

    class SomeClass {

        @Override // Violation
        String toString() {
            return ''
        }

        @NonCPS
        @Override // OK
        boolean equals(Object other) {
            return false
        }
    }
