*Since CodeNarc 0.13*

A method was found without an implementation. If the method is overriding or implementing a parent method,
then mark it with the `@Override` annotation. This rule should not be used with Java 5 code because you cannot
put `@Override` on a method implementing an interface. Use with Java 6 and higher.

Example of violations:

```
    class MyClass {

        // violation, empty method
        public void method1() {}

        // violation, empty method
        def method2() {}

        // OK because of @Override
        @Override
        public void method3() {}
    }

    abstract class MyBaseClass {
        // OK, handled by EmptyMethodInAbstractClass Rule
        public void method() {}
    }
```
