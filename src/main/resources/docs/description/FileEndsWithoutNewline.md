Makes sure each source file ends with a newline character.

NOTE: This is a file-based rule, rather than an AST-based rule, so the *applyToClassNames* and
*doNotApplyToClassNames* rule configuration properties are not available. See
[Standard Properties for Configuring Rules](./codenarc-configuring-rules.html#standard-properties-for-configuring-rules).
