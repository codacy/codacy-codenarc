Checks for an *import* of a class that is within the same package as the importing class.

NOTE: This is a file-based rule, rather than a typical AST-based rule, so the *applyToClassNames*
and *doNotApplyToClassNames* rule configuration properties are not available. See
[Standard Properties for Configuring Rules](./codenarc-configuring-rules.html#standard-properties-for-configuring-rules).
