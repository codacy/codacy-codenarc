*Since CodeNarc 0.13*

This rule finds test cases that are coupled to other test cases, either
by invoking static methods on another test case or by creating instances
of another test case. If you require shared logic in test cases then
extract that logic to a new class where it can properly be reused.
Static references to methods on the current test class are ignored.

Example of violations:

        class MyTest extends GroovyTestCase {
            public void testMethod() {
                // violation, static method call to other test
                MyOtherTest.helperMethod()

                // violation, instantiation of another test class
                new MyOtherTest()

                // no violation; same class
                def input = MyTest.getResourceAsStream('sample.txt')
            }
        }
