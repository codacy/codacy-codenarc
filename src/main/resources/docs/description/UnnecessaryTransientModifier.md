*Since CodeNarc 0.13*

The field is marked as transient, but the class isnâ€™t Serializable, so
marking it as transient has no effect. This may be leftover marking from
a previous version of the code in which the class was transient, or it
may indicate a misunderstanding of how serialization works.

Some Java frameworks change the semantics of the transient keyword. For
instance, when using Terracotta the transient keyword may have slightly
different semantics. You may need to turn this rule off depending on
which Java frameworks are in use.

Examples:

``` 
    class MyClass {
        // class not serializable, violation occurs
        transient String property
    }

    class MySerializableClass implements Serializable {
        // OK, class is serializable
        transient String property
    }
```
